Here we are going to create a ticket in order for someone to help us with our sitution from your computer not turning on, resetting password, to rebooting your computer whatever situtation you need you have to start of with a ticket. If a customer calls and has yet to create a ticket you as a help desk can also create a ticket for the customer.

Communicating with the customer is vary prompt even if you don't understand the ticket always communicate with the customer and keep them inform of the situtaion or can also get in contact with them and ask them about whats going on. Communcating with co workers is also important just in case you don't understand the customers ticket, but posting updates in the customers ticket is very important that why if someone can help you they will.
